# DeepPAC: PAC based Robustness Analysis for DNNs

DeepPAC is a tool to analyse robustness for deep neural networks (DNNs) with the probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee, which is an an implementation of the algorithms in our technical article titled "Towards Practical Robustness Analysis for DNNs based on PAC-Model Learning".

DeepPAC is now open source under the `Apache-2.0` License. We intend to apply the Reusable & Available Badges in the ICSE 2022 artifact evaluation.
